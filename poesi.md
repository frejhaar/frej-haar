But critical outfits subcultured in shame

for him who sausage loves

But critical outfits subcultured in shame

And in other times we baste the elves 

so he donned his old tog

o the mighty may chose to smote-smote

Why is it Bill Gates looks like a frog?

Though filled with elegance and charm, take note.
